Roger platform software
=======================


This directory contains all software pieces brought to you 
as example of what can be executed on the platform.

This sample package contains:

+ linux kernel
+ initrd files
+ busybox


The directory embeds two scripts provided as kickstart of the
building process.
./build_soft.sh will help you build all software stack.
./clean_soft.sh will help you making room in the directory.

On top of these scripts, you will have to install beforehand a 
cross compilation toolchain. We suggest you use the codesourcery
one, which is a lazy yet efficient way to accomplish this step.
You can download it from http://www.codesourcery.com/sgpp/lite/arm
(you need to chose the "GNU/Linux" Target OS, providing
arm-none-linux-gnueabi-* executables, or set RABBITS_CROSS_COMPILE
accordingly in soft_env).

Once the toolchain is installed you will have to set correct values
in the soft_env file. This file will be sourced so that all building
steps are aware of your toolchain.
